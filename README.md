# Review of my first shell scripting program.
## ari.py

My first shell scripting program is about to calculate Automated redability index of text files.
The automated readability index is a readability test designed to measure the how easy our text is to understand.
Its calculated by using the Formula :4.71 x (characters/words) + 0.5 x (words/sentences) â€“ 21.43.

The grade level will be different according to the ARI value :
That means:


Score Age 	Grade Level


1 	  5-6 	Kindergarten


2 	  6-7 	First Grade


3 	  7-8 	Second Grade


4 	  8-9 	Third Grade


5 	  9-10 	Fourth Grade


6 	 10-11 	Fifth Grade




7 	 11-12 	Sixth Grade


8 	 12-13 	Seventh Grade


9 	 13-14 	Eighth Grade


10 	 14-15 	Ninth Grade


11 	 15-16 	Tenth Grade


12 	 16-17 	Eleventh Grade


13 	 17-18 	Twelfth Grade


14 	 18-22 	College student 

## The basic idea about to solve this problem :


1.Read the file content.


2.Find the number of characters,words and sentance present in the file.


3.Declar a function(calculate_ari) pass these value as argument.By using these value calculate ARI.


4.The ARI value passsed to an another function(determine_grade_level) for finding grade.

## How I find solution :


Read file content and find required values.


Refer google and chatgpt and find `**content=$(cat "$file")` can store content of file and i find character, words and sentance by `chars=$(echo -n "$content" | wc -m)`
`words=$(echo -n "$content" | wc -w)`
`sentences=$(echo -n "$content" | grep -o '[.!?]' | wc -l)`

Function

Refer google how to write function in shell scripting. And find the solution .In function call `calculate_ari $chars $words $sentences` Pass 3 values as argument. `local chars=$1 ` Assign value of the first argument to the local variable "chars".Like that all the argument values are assign to variables. And find ARI value by substituting values to Equation  .
Declear another function `determine_grade_level()` for finding grade.Using if elif each test cases were checked.

## Program accuracy

Test cases checked by using different files containing different character count , sentence and words..
